                    <h2>Luca Nardo</h2>
                    <h3>Researcher</h3>
                    <p id="text_test">Luca Nardo is an experimental physicist specialized in electronic-state transition spectroscopy applied to the study of biological, biomedical, and pharmacological systems, and to the characterization of new materials.</p>
                    <p>He has obtained a PhD in Physics in July 2008 and is presently working on a tenure-track research fellowship at the Department of Science and High Technology of the University of Insubria.</p>
                    <p>His research activity is mainly based on the implementation of advanced fluorescence techniques, such as time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), confocal microscopy, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), applied both on molecular ensembles and at the single-molecule level.</p>
                    <p>Nardo has also professional experience in biomedical optics, laser physics and detector physics.</p>
